# This is where you need to put the public keys. This variable is simply a
#   dictionary for:
#  - name
#  - remote destination user
#  - public key
#
# Specifically:
#  - authkeys_public_keys.name is a specific string to be referenced in the
#    authkeys_enabled variable, which will either add or remove the key from
#    the location
#  - authkeys_public_keys.destination is the destination account for which the
#    key will be applied.
#  - authkeys_public_keys.public_key contains the public key for the user.
#
# The authkeys_enabled variable
#

# authkeys_public_keys:
#   - username: "root-root"
#     destination: "root"
#     public_key: "ssh-rsa key comment"

# authkeys_enabled:
#    - "root-root"
