# This is where you need to put the public keys:
#  - authkeys_public_keys.username is the remote username, that is -- the
#    external user, that will be put into the appropriate location.
#  - authkeys_public_keys.public_key contains the public key for the user
#
# The authkeys_destination links the public key with a location which to place
# the key:
#  - authkeys_destination.username links to authkeys_public_keys.username
#  - authkeys_destination.destination is the home directory in which to place
#    the key.
#

# authkeys_public_keys:
#   - username: "root"
#     public_key: "ssh-rsa blahblahblah comment"

# authkeys_destination:
#    - username: "root"
#      destination: "root"
